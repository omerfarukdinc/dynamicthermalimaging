(a) Four axes to calculate the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) from the 2D temperature distribution images.(b) A transient thermal image from the surface during laser irradiation. (c) Calculated FWHM as a function of frames (i.e.,time points) at four axes. (d) Estimated peak temperatures as a function of frames (i.e., time points) in four axes.
